## What is WuiButton

WuiButton is a simple button component made for WizUI.
It uses [wuiButtonBehavior] to setup events to listen on.
This component inherits from [WuiDom] and utilizes WizUI's buttonBehavior.

It only sets CSS class on some events, so only styling is necessary.
Its main CSS class name is 'WuiButton' and already set the pointer style for mouse over effect.
